#Supplementary File S1 - SVG file showing the ultrafast bootstrap opsin phylogenetic tree (UFB1). See the colour bar in Figure 1 to discriminate the different opsin groups. Ultrafast bootstrap values at the nodes. The outgroup, in black, represents melatonin receptors. <br><br>
#Supplementary File S2 - SVG file showing the transfer bootstrap estimation opsin phylogenetic tree (TBE). See the colour bar in Figure 1 to discriminate the different opsin groups. TBE values at the nodes. The outgroup, in black, represents melatonin receptors. <br><br>
#Supplementary File S3 - SVG file showing the ultrafast bootstrap opsin phylogenetic tree (UFB2) computed after removing rogue taxa. See the colour bar in Figure 1 to discriminate the different opsin groups. Ultrafast bootstrap values at the nodes. The outgroup, in black, represents melatonin receptors. <br><br>
#Supplementary File S4 - SVG file showing the ultrafast bootstrap opsin phylogenetic tree (UFB2) computed after removing melatonin receptors and placopsins. See the colour bar in Figure 1 to discriminate the different opsin groups. Ultrafast bootstrap values at the nodes. The outgroup, in black, represents melatonin receptors. <br><br>
#Supplementary File S5 Table containing all the species analysed including their BUSCO score, the number of opsin found in each genome and the accession number. <br><br>
#Supplementary File S6 – Opsin dataset 1, FASTA file containing opsin sequences extracted from the translated genomes plus a pre-compiled list of sequences taken from the litterature. <br><br>
#Supplementary File S7 - Opsin dataset 2, FASTA file containig opsin sequences extracted from the translated genomes and in which rogue taxa have been removed. <br><br>
#Supplementary File S8 - CSV file containing sequences scored according their Transfer Index, showing the list of rogue taxa.<br><br>
#Supplementary File S9 - TXT file containg the result of the model test analysis. <br><br>
#Supplementary Figure S1 - Table showing important amino acidic sites in pseudopsins using opsins as reference <br><br>
#Supplementary Figure S2 - CLANS analysis <br><br>
#Supplementary Figure S3 - Table showing the different data (species number, busco value, photoreceptive structures and larval stages) for all the taxa analysed
