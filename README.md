#Supplementary Material 1 - SVG file showing the ultrafastbootstrap (UFB) opsin phylogenetic tree. See the colour bar in Figure 1 to discriminate the different opsin groups. Ultrafast bootstrap values at the node. The outgroup, in black, represents melatonin receptors. <br><br>
#Supplementary Material 2 - SVG file showing the transfer bootstrap estimation (TBE) opsin phylogenetic tree. See the colour bar in Figure 1 to discriminate the different opsin groups. TBE values at the node. The outgroup, in black, represents melatonin receptors. <br><br>
#Supplementary Material 3 - SVG file showing the ultrafastbootstrap (UFB) opsin phylogenetic tree computed after removing rogue taxa. See the colour bar in Figure 1 to discriminate the different opsin groups. Ultrafast bootstrap values at the node. The outgroup, in black, represents melatonin receptors. <br><br>
#Supplementary Material 4 – Opsin dataset 1, FASTA file containing opsin sequences extracted from the translated genomes plus a pre-compiled list of sequences taken from the litterature. <br><br>
#Supplementary Material 5 - Opsin dataset 2, FASTA file containig opsin sequences extracted from the translated genomes and in which rogue taxa have been removed. <br><br>
#Supplementary Material 6 - CSV file containing sequences scored according their Transfer Index, showing the list of rogue taxa.
