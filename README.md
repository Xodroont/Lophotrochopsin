#Supplementary File S1 - SVG file showing the ultrafastbootstrap opsin phylogenetic tree (UFB1). See the colour bar in Figure 1 to discriminate the different opsin groups. Ultrafast bootstrap values at the nodes. The outgroup, in black, represents melatonin receptors. <br><br>
#Supplementary File S2 - SVG file showing the transfer bootstrap estimation opsin phylogenetic tree (TBE). See the colour bar in Figure 1 to discriminate the different opsin groups. TBE values at the nodes. The outgroup, in black, represents melatonin receptors. <br><br>
#Supplementary File S3 - SVG file showing the ultrafastbootstrap opsin phylogenetic tree (UFB2) computed after removing rogue taxa. See the colour bar in Figure 1 to discriminate the different opsin groups. Ultrafast bootstrap values at the nodes. The outgroup, in black, represents melatonin receptors. <br><br>
#Supplementary File S4 – Opsin dataset 1, FASTA file containing opsin sequences extracted from the translated genomes plus a pre-compiled list of sequences taken from the litterature. <br><br>
#Supplementary File S5 - Opsin dataset 2, FASTA file containig opsin sequences extracted from the translated genomes and in which rogue taxa have been removed. <br><br>
#Supplementary File S6 - CSV file containing sequences scored according their Transfer Index, showing the list of rogue taxa.<br><br>
#Supplementary Figure S1 - Table showing important amino acidic sites in pseudopsins using opsins as reference <br><br>
#Supplementary Figure S2 - CLANS analysis <br><br>
