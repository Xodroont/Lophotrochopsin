# Lophotrochopsin

Supplementary Material 1 - Ultrafast bootstrap opsin phylogenetic tree. See the colour bar in Figure 1 to discriminate the different opsin groups. Ultrafast bootstrap values at the node. The outgroup, in black, represents melatonin receptors.
Supplementary Material 2 - Transfer bootstrap estimation opsin phylogenetic tree. See the colour bar in Figure 1 to discriminate the different opsin groups. TBE values at the node. The outgroup, in black, represents melatonin receptors. 
Supplementary Material 3 â€“ Final opsin dataset.
Supplementary Material 4 - Final opsin dataset without rogue taxa.
Supplementary Material 5 - Unrooted opsin dataset.
Supplementary Material 6 - List of sequences with high bootstrap index.
